# SIR

This is an implemantation for something like dns for my web project

## Setup

1. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Zeviraty/SIR`
2. initialize the database `cd SIR && ./dbcli full-init`
3. change the Server Name in the sn file
4. contact an already existing SIR server to add to the network (eg: #web)
5. start the server `python3 sir.py`
